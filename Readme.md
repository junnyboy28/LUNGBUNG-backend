1. Project Structure

The repository is structured to organize code, models, and dependencies, making it maintainable and scalable. The main components are:

app/: Contains the core application logic, including model loading, prediction endpoint, and utility functions.
main.py: The entry point of the backend application. It sets up the FastAPI app, loads the models, and defines the prediction endpoint.
models.py: Defines the architecture of the CNN encoder, Transformer decoder, and the overall X-ray report generation model.
utils.py: Provides utility functions for image transformation, report generation, summarization, and suggestion generation.
models/: Stores the downloaded machine learning models and associated files.
model_checkpoints/: Contains the saved weights for the encoder and decoder of the report generation model, along with vocabulary information.
t5_model/: Holds the files for the pre-trained T5 model used for summarization.
t5_tokenizer/: Contains the tokenizer files for the T5 model.
requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python libraries for the backend application to function.
Dockerfile: Provides instructions for building a Docker image of the application, making it portable and easy to deploy.
2. Workflow

The application follows this workflow when a request is made to the /predict/ endpoint:

Image Input: The endpoint receives an X-ray image file (PNG or JPG) as input.
Image Transformation: The transform_image function in utils.py resizes the image, converts it to a tensor, and normalizes it using the appropriate transformations.
Report Generation: The transformed image is passed to the generate_report function, which utilizes the loaded report generation model to produce a textual description of the X-ray findings.
Summarization: The generated report is then fed to the generate_summary function, which employs the T5 model to create a concise summary of the key findings.
Suggestion Generation: The summary is passed to the generate_suggestions function, which uses the Random Forest model to provide suggestions for further actions based on the summary's content.
Output: The endpoint returns a JSON response containing the generated report, summary, and suggestions.
3. Purpose

The overall purpose of this repository is to provide a backend system that can automate the analysis of X-ray images. It utilizes pre-trained and fine-tuned machine learning models to:

Generate detailed reports describing the findings in the X-ray images.
Create concise summaries of the reports for quick understanding.
Offer suggestions for further actions, aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.
